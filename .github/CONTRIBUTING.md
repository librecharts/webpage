### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/librecharts/webpage/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/librecharts/webpage/issues) to find one that interests you.  If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Requests

When you open a pull request you'll be provided with a check-list, please ensure you complete all of these items.

Further, ensure you self review your pull request and that it follows our [semantic commit/PR name guidelines](#nomenclature-and-naming).
